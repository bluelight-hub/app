      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the TypeScript error analysis task into specific subtasks covering different aspects: compiler error collection, error categorization, pattern identification, and dependency mapping.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires technical expertise in TypeScript and understanding of the codebase structure. It involves multiple analytical steps including running compiler checks, documenting errors, categorizing them, and creating dependency diagrams. The complexity comes from the need to understand the relationships between components."

      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the AddAttachmentDto correction task into implementation and validation subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "This is a relatively straightforward task focused on correcting a single DTO class. The implementation details are already well-defined in the task description with a code example. The complexity is low as it involves modifying a single file with clear requirements."

      "complexityScore": 3,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the UeberschreibeEtbDto correction task into implementation and validation subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to task 2, this is a focused task on correcting a single DTO class with clear requirements. The complexity is low as it involves adding a missing field and potentially removing an incorrect one, with a provided code example."

      "taskTitle": "Anpassung des ETB-Services für korrekte DTO-Verwendung",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the ETB service adaptation task into subtasks for identifying usage points, implementing changes, and verifying type consistency.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex as it requires understanding how the DTOs are used throughout the service, making appropriate changes to method signatures and implementations, and ensuring type consistency. It affects multiple methods and requires careful coordination with the updated DTOs."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the ETB controller adaptation task into subtasks for endpoint identification, parameter updates, and Swagger documentation updates.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to task 4, this requires understanding how the DTOs are used in the controller, updating endpoint parameters and decorators, and ensuring Swagger documentation is updated. The complexity comes from ensuring all endpoints are correctly modified while maintaining API consistency."

      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the ETB service test correction task into test fixture updates and test case verification subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves updating test fixtures and expectations to match the corrected DTOs. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding the existing tests and ensuring they properly validate the updated service functionality."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Korrektur der ETB-Controller-Tests",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 2,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the ETB controller test correction task into HTTP request updates and response validation subtasks.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to task 6, this involves updating test fixtures for HTTP requests and ensuring the tests properly validate the controller's behavior. The complexity is moderate as it requires understanding the existing controller tests and API interactions."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Überprüfung auf weitere Typinkonsistenzen im ETB-Modul",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the type inconsistency review task into subtasks for strict compiler analysis, any-type replacement, return type verification, and variable type checking.",
      "reasoning": "This is a more complex task as it involves a comprehensive review of the entire ETB module with stricter TypeScript settings. It requires deep understanding of TypeScript's type system and the ability to identify and fix various type inconsistencies throughout the codebase."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the integration and system testing task into subtasks for automated tests, manual testing of key workflows, API validation, cross-module interaction testing, and documentation verification.",
      "reasoning": "This is a complex task that involves comprehensive testing across multiple levels. It requires running existing integration tests, performing manual testing of key workflows, verifying API documentation, and ensuring cross-module interactions work correctly. The complexity comes from the breadth of testing required and the need to verify that all changes work together correctly."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation task into subtasks for technical documentation, API documentation updates, and final review.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating comprehensive documentation of all changes made. While not technically complex, it requires attention to detail and a thorough understanding of all the changes that were implemented. The complexity is moderate as it involves synthesizing information from multiple tasks."
