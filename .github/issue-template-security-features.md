# Task 18: Implement Security and Access Control Features

## Overview

Add advanced security features including IP whitelisting, session monitoring, and security alerts.

## Main Objectives

- Create SecurityService with IP whitelisting, session monitoring, and threat detection
- Implement security-related API endpoints
- Build SecurityPage with active session management
- Add failed login attempt tracking and account lockout
- Implement security alert notifications and incident response

## Subtasks

The following subtasks will be created as separate issues:

### 1. IP Whitelist API

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Develop RESTful API to manage allowed IP addresses
  - Design CRUD endpoints
  - Integrate with auth middleware
  - Store whitelist in secure datastore
  - Implement rate-limiting and audit logging

### 2. Session Monitoring Service

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Create backend service to track active user sessions
  - Capture login/logout events
  - Maintain session cache
  - Expose metrics
  - Support WebSocket stream for dashboards

### 3. Failed Login Tracking & Lockout

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Implement failed login counter and account lockout
  - Store attempt counters
  - Configurable thresholds/durations
  - CAPTCHA integration
  - Add API callbacks for alerts

### 4. Notification Channels

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Provide pluggable notification channels
  - Abstract sender interface
  - Secrets management
  - Retry logic
  - Templating
  - Channel health monitoring

### 5. Threat Detection Rules

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Define and implement suspicious activity detection
  - Rule engine framework
  - Pattern library (brute force, IP mismatch)
  - Unit tests
  - Rule versioning
  - Hot reload support

### 6. Security Alerts Engine

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Build alert evaluation and dispatch engine
  - Streaming pipeline
  - Severity scoring
  - Deduplication
  - Alert correlation
  - Send via Notification Channels

### 7. Compliance Logging

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Add immutable security event logs
  - Integrate with centralized log store
  - Signed log records
  - Retention policies
  - Audit export APIs

### 8. Admin UI Pages

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Develop security management web interface
  - React UI components
  - Role-based access
  - Real-time dashboards
  - Configuration forms
  - User friendly error handling

### 9. Penetration Tests

- [ ] Issue #[TBD]: Conduct security testing
  - Engage certified testers
  - Black/grey box tests
  - Report findings
  - Remediation verification
  - Executive summary

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/admin/security/sessions` - List active sessions
- `POST /api/admin/security/whitelist` - Manage IP whitelist
- `GET /api/admin/security/alerts` - View security alerts
- `POST /api/admin/security/lockout` - Configure lockout settings
- `GET /api/admin/security/threats` - View threat detection status

## Test Strategy

- Test IP whitelisting functionality
- Verify session monitoring accuracy
- Validate security alert generation
- Test account lockout mechanisms
- Penetration testing for all security features

## Dependencies

- Task #2: Admin Dashboard Infrastructure (✅ Complete)
- Task #5: Audit Logging Infrastructure (✅ Complete)
